    <h5>Hello!</h5>
    <p class="aboutus"> Tidbits is a 4-student team for a Hackathon for the
    University of Washington. We are passionate about creating for social good
    and inclusive design. We wanted to make a platform that would be equally
    accessible to those with mobility disorders as everyone else, especially
    because in our research we found that mobility disorders often lead to
    anxiety and social alienation. Journaling and mood tracking can help with
    these things, as well as reducing stress and creating awareness for
    negative influences.</p>
